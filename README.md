Overview

This project provides an end-to-end E-commerce sales and shipping cost analysis using Tableau, focusing on insights from a fictitious online pet supply store, Munchyâ€™s. The analysis identifies top-selling products, profit margins, customer distribution by state, and opportunities for cost reduction in shipping. This project utilizes interactive dashboards to deliver actionable insights for business decision-making.
Objectives

    Analyze sales performance and profitability across different product categories.
    Identify top-selling and most profitable products.
    Conduct Market Basket Analysis to suggest cross-selling opportunities.
    Investigate customer distribution by location and Lifetime Value (LTV) by state.
    Optimize shipping costs by analyzing quantity discounts and regional cost variations.
    Provide strategic recommendations for cost-saving and revenue growth.

Key Findings

    Sales & Profitability
        Pet food and disposable products are the highest revenue generators.
        Electronics (pet cameras) have the highest profit margins.
        Texas, California, and Florida have the highest customer LTV, making them prime markets for targeted marketing.

    Market Basket Analysis
        High correlation between Dog Poop Bags and Memory Foam Pet Beds, indicating a cross-sell opportunity.
        Products like UltraSound Dog Barking Deterrent and Premium Dog Food show strong purchase relationships.

    Shipping Cost Optimization
        Shipping single-unit products increases costs significantly; bulk purchasing should be encouraged through discounts.
        The East Coast accounts for 50% of shipping costs; a distribution center in the region could cut costs.
